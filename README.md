🏙️ Bengaluru Traffic Analysis

📊 Project Overview
-This project focuses on analyzing traffic patterns in Bengaluru (Bangalore) to uncover insights related to congestion, travel time, and traffic intensity across different regions and time periods.
The goal is to understand the key factors contributing to traffic congestion and identify data-driven solutions for better urban mobility planning.

🎯 Objectives
-Analyze Bengaluru traffic data to identify congestion trends
-Visualize traffic density based on time, location, and day of week
-Derive meaningful insights for smart city improvements
-Apply data cleaning, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and visualization techniques
